  The players belong to the following teams:
  - Heroes: ${heroes}
  - Villains: ${villains}

  Write a funny and entertaining story about what happened. Make sure:
  1. Player actions strictly align with their roles as Heroes or Villains.
  2. Heroes should act heroically, trying to stop Villains and protect others.
  3. Villains should act villainously, trying to cause chaos or achieve their evil goals.
  4. Do not contradict the player roles or assign actions that conflict with their team alignment.

  Additionally:
  - Include a plot twist where possible, but do not explicitly mention that there is a plot twist.
  - Talk about the actions of every player, and make it interesting to read.
  - Do not include magical elements or supernatural interventions. Keep it realistic.
  - If a player did not provide an answer, reflect that in the story by showing them failing or dying.
  - Ensure there is always a winning team by the end of the story.

  Important:
  - If a player's role is Hero, they must not act as a Villain.
  - If a player's role is Villain, they must not act as a Hero.
  - The story must end with either the Heroes or Villains winning clearly.
